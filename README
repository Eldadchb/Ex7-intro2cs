I discussed the exercise with: Kfir (פיילוט אינטרו).

Simple and advanced recursive functions.=

======================
=  Special Comments  =
======================

1. is_prime

The main function = o(1)
The helper function = o(n)
Total running time from n-1 to 2 is o(n).

2. print_no_repetition_sequences

I don't know how to calculate it :(

3. flood_fill

The worst case = the function will fill the entire points. It means o(n*m)
